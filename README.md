## Description

### Why I do it?

I think games should be like games - with pixels of 2D graphics. And I want to make a snake-like game with some new gameplay mechanic. For example, what about snaky with powerups, like "magnet", "speed up", "minions" or obstacles on map like traps or portals? Or... what about multiplayer with a lot of player on a single map with elements of battle royal?
